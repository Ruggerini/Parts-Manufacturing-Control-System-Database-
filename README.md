Parts Manufacturing Control System Database. By Carlos Ruggiero, Ángel Calmen

Made with: 

-Visual Studio Code -> We chose python as this project's language. And used the following libraries: Tkinter (for GUI), Pillow (for images), mysql.connector 
(to connect DB with our code), re, io and reportlab (pdf generator).

MySQL Workbench -> Here we made the ER-Diagram of our database model.

HeidiSQL/MariaDB (in terminal) -> Here is where we created the database and inserted the records.
